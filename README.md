🌟 ANTLR Math Equation Parser Project 🌟
Hey there! 😊 This project is all about creating a Math Equation Parser using ANTLR in Python. It's pretty cool how it all comes together to solve math equations, and I’m excited to share it with you! 💻✨

🤔 What is ANTLR?
ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a super powerful tool for creating parsers. It’s used to read and process text or code by breaking it down based on a grammar you define. Think of it like a little helper that understands the structure of any text you give it! 😄 For this project, I used ANTLR to build a parser for mathematical equations. 📐

🐍 Why Python?
So, why did I choose Python for this? Well, Python is like my go-to language because it’s simple, clean, and super versatile! 🧑‍💻 It has this easy-to-read syntax and awesome libraries, which made it perfect for quickly building and testing my math parser. Plus, Python's great for solving problems like this without too much hassle! 🐍💡

➗ The Math Equation Solver 🧮
Here’s the fun part — the Math Equation Solver works by creating a parser and a parse tree! 🌳

Parser: ANTLR helps me build a parser that breaks down math equations (like 3 + 2 * (5 - 1)) into understandable chunks. It checks if the expression makes sense according to the grammar I set up and makes sure it’s all structured correctly. ✅

Parse Tree: Once the parser works its magic, it generates a parse tree (or abstract syntax tree). The tree shows the relationships and structure of the equation, which is super helpful when solving it. 🧠💫 For example, the expression 3 + 2 * (5 - 1) gets broken down to respect the order of operations (multiplication before addition, yay!).

At the end, the parse tree helps solve the equation in the correct order! 🎉
